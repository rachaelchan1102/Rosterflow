"""Workspaces: the unit of state every API request operates on.

A workspace holds one roster (Data) plus the scheduling state layered on top of it:
- a DRAFT schedule (what the solver last produced, plus any hand edits like a cancellation)
- a PUBLISHED schedule (the schedule of record, frozen until the coordinator publishes again)
- LOCKS (keep this musician on this show no matter what) and BANS (never put this musician on
  this show / at this facility)

Re-solving is explicit, never automatic. When the roster changes, the draft is kept as-is and
marked stale (`needs_resolve`), so a schedule nobody asked to change never silently shifts under
the coordinator. A re-solve then keeps everything already in the draft unless it has to move it
(the solver's `stability` weight), and reports every move it did make.

Two kinds of workspace, same class: one per playground visitor (in memory, gone on refresh), and
one shared coordinator workspace backed by Postgres (see registry.py).
