"""Phase 4: backups. For each show, ranks 3 standby musicians — fairness (who's played least),
then distance, then rotation (SPEC.md section 9) — and swaps in a pianist if none of the top 3
happens to be one, since losing the pianist needs to always be recoverable when possible.

No CP-SAT here — this is a ranking problem, not a joint optimization, so it's its own lighter
pass like carpool.py. The one real coupling across shows is SPEC's "one person can be a backup
for only one show per day," so shows are processed date-by-date and a backup already used for an
earlier show that day is removed from later shows' candidate pools on the same day.

Being a backup — even a top-ranked one — never counts toward a musician's monthly cap or their
fairness "played" count unless they're actually activated for a cancellation (phase 5).
