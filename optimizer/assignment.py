"""Phase 2: the assignment optimizer. Decides who plays each show and how many songs.

True hard constraints (never relaxed): availability, guardian-distance for under-17s, one show
per musician per day, and each musician's own minimum set length (everyone plays >= their min).

Everything else is a *soft* constraint with a weight. Two of these are release valves rather
than targets — going over a musician's monthly cap, or asking them for more songs than their own
stated max — priced high enough that the solver only reaches for them when there's genuinely no
other way to keep a show staffed. The rest follow SPEC.md section 6's priority order: "fully
staffed" (3+ musicians, pianist present, songs covered) gets by far the largest weight, then fair
workload, then low travel, then rotation. If a show genuinely can't be filled even with those
release valves, the solver still returns the best schedule it can rather than failing outright —
that show just shows up flagged as needing attention downstream.

Travel cost here is a simplified proxy (raw musician-to-facility distance for whoever's
assigned) — the real car-pooled travel cost only exists after carpool.py groups people into cars
(phase 3). This term just discourages picking a far-away musician when a closer one works too.
