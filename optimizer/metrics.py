"""Phase 7: the metrics/KPI layer — SPEC.md sections 12.1 (control tower) and 13.

This layer only reads what the layers below it already computed (assignment, carpool, backups)
— it runs no new optimization or simulation of its own. Its job is purely aggregation: turn
those separate outputs into the control tower's per-show flags table and headline KPI numbers.
